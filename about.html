<div style="padding:15px;"><p>I am Jayanth. I love to bake and experiment in the kitchen. My kitchen is<br> my safe haven and happy place. I bake when I am stressed, when I am <br>happy, when I am tensed and even when I am sad. So, I thought why not<br> make money out of it. That was the start of Cafe Brew.. I have always <br>been a huge caffeine consumer; drinking coffee after waking up, after <br>going to work, in the meetings, in the evenings, before going to bed and<br> anywhere in between. At some point, I realized that I actually couldn't <br>survive without my daily dose of coffee and that is where Cafe Brew's <br>tagline comes from.</p></div></div>
